frob check --type python --only gates flags 769 DOC001 warnings (frob.toml legacy baseline). The bulk are docs/workflow/work-orders/WO-*.md and docs/workflow/design-log/*.md files that carry no frob:describes anchor, no frob:doc edge, and are unreachable by markdown link crawl from docs/index.md or README.md.

Design-log entries are explicitly frozen history (lithos CLAUDE.md: NEVER sweep or edit these) so those stay warn-only permanently via frob.toml's [gates.severity] DOC001=warn baseline. Work-order files are live and should be linked: add an index section in docs/index.md (or docs/workflow/README.md, then link that from docs/index.md) enumerating active/closed WOs so DOC001 clears for that subset without touching frozen design-log content.

Origin: frob enforcement adoption sweep (frob check --only gates dry run).
